  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Performance Art Event is an internationally oriented organization with the objective to show the diversity of performance art.</p>
  <p>PAE provides a platform for performance artists from the Netherlands and abroad to further performance art as a discipline while showing its diversity.</p>
  <p>PAE strives to realize performance art in close collaboration with artists worldwide by offering support while creating the most ideal conditions regarding artists needs.</p>
  <p>In the current performance culture, exceptions excluded, performance art often plays a supportive role in other events and does not always receive the attention and appreciation it deserves as a discipline.</p>
  <p>Performance art seems challenging to present because it does not fit in the established and well-known worlds of art conservation and sales in galleries and museums, and traditional performances/productions in the theater. Because this is a prevailing issue not only in the Netherlands, we are inclusive of all nationalities, ethnicities, genders, etc.</p>
  <p>To further the awareness of performance art as a discipline, PAE has been organizing events dedicated to performance art only.PAE offers space for improvisation in actual situations in the most radical sense. The emerging intensity becomes an important aspect of the work. The perishable character of performance art can be considered a starting point in a performance, possibly as a rebellion against the over-defined and static position of art history.</p>
  <p>We look forward to continue growing the PAE platform and creating opportunities for performance artists while raising awareness of the intriguing performance art discipline. We welcome anyone to attend and experience our performance art events that are interactive and inspiring.</p>
